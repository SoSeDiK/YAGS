YAGS was made to make the daily Genshin routine less annoying.

This script tries to improve controls, automate repeatable things, and bring some useful shortcuts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Script is made solely for 1920x1080 game resolution with stable 60FPS and low ping in mind (not a necessity, but some things *might* not work as expected). The script might not work unless the game is in [borderless mode](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/376533).
> 
> There are no plans to adapt it to other resolutions in the near future.

### ❓ How to
1. Extract and run the script. Pick one of the options:
	- Using release build (preferred):
		- [Download](https://github.com/SoSeDiK/YAGS/releases/latest/download/YAGS.exe) the latest version of the script and put it in some folder.
		- Run `YAGS.exe`.
	- Using development build:
		- Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (❕version 2 is required❕).
		- Download this repository, extract `YAGS` folder.
		- Run `YAGS.ahk`.
		- (!) Keep in mind that development builds do not support auto updating.

> [!WARNING]
> Some antivirus software report the `.exe` file as a virus. The script controls user input and has access to the Internet for optional auto update, so it's understanable. You may use the `.ahk` instead or add the file to exclusions.

2. Configure the settings in the GUI if needed.
3. Run the game and enjoy.
4. Press `Alt + B` to bring the script on top if needed.
5. Press `End` in case of an emergency to force stop the script.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to work properly, the script must be able to run with administrator privileges. This is due to the game not handling AHK's keyboard and mouse inputs properly otherwise.

### 🎨 Features
- Hold `F` to spam `F` >:)
- Hold `XButton1` to spam `F` even more!
  - For some reason, it's easier for me to use a mouse than to press `F`.
  - You may also use this to skip dialogues (you still have to do the choices manually).
- Click `XButton1` to press `T` (to travel via Four-Leaf Sigils with a mouse).
- Hold `Space` to jump continuously.
  - Can be used to Bunnyhop (enter the sprinting mode and start jumping).
- Hold `XButton2` to jump continuously too!
  - Yes, I'm too lazy for `Spacebar` (mouse walking-sprinting-jumping power!). Bunnyhop is possible as well.
  - Works with Waveriders.
  - May be used to skip dialogues too, but in addition also auto picks up the mission option, if available, or the latest dialogue choice.
- Hold `1-5` keys to switch characters.
  - I can not be the only one who have chosen the wrong character in the past, and had to rage spam my keyboard to get another character asap, right? RIGHT?!
- Press `MMB` to toggle AutoWalk!
  - Press `RMB` to toggle sprint while auto walking. Hold `RMB` to continuously run instead of dashing (useful to start Bunnyhopping).
  - `LShift` can be used too for manual sprinting.
- Press `H` to toggle Vision!
  - Makes it much easier, less annoying, and had to be done since `MMB` was changed.
- Hold `V` to auto attack!
  - By default does nothing. Press `Numpad *` + `Numpad 1-4` to change currently available modes:
    - `1`: Klee Simple Jump Cancel (NJ)
    - `2`: Klee Charged Attack (CJ)
    - `3`: Hu Tao Dash Cancel (9N2CD)
    - `4`: Hu Tao Jump Cancel (9N2CJ)
  - Probably will be reworked in the future with support for more characters and… stuff.
- Press `MMB` while on the map to quickly teleport.
  - Especially useful when there are multiple icons near the teleportation point. Saves a few clicks, seconds, and your sanity.

### ✨ Minor (possibly useful) additions
- Press `MMB` to:
  - Collect all expeditions and resend them.
  - Collect Coins and Companion Exp in Tea Pot.
  - Select and craft max ores (or other things in Blacksmith's menu).
  - Obtain crafted item.
  - Lock/Unlock an artifact or a weapon.
  - Enhance artifact/weapon.
  - Click «Craft»/«Convert» button in Crafting Bench.
	- Additionally, by using `XButton1` and `XButton2` you can press «+» and «-» to increase or decrease the crafting amount.
  - Perform mystic offering.
  - Click «Confirm» button in some popups.
  - Click «Continue Challenge» in Domain.
  - Click «Skip» in Domain/Wish/Cutscenes.
  - Toggle «Auto-Play Story» mode in dialogue.
- Press `XButton1` to quickly purchase items from the shop.
  - Press `XButton2` to purchase items continuously. Press again to stop.
- `Numpad +` + `Numpad 0-9` to change current party (0 is 10).
- `Numpad -` + `Numpad 5` to go to the Serenitea Pot (via gadget).
- `Numpad -` + `Numpad 8` to obtain all BP experience and rewards.
- `Numpad -` + `Numpad .` to relogin.
  - Useful for resetting bosses.
- `Numpad /` + `Numpad 1-9` to quickly change the time.
  - Think of numbers as of the in-game clock:
    - Numpad:        Time:
    - `7` `8` `9`   ` 9` `12` `15`
    - `4` ` ` `6`   ` 6` `  ` `18`
    - `1` `2` `3`   ` 3` `24` `21`
    - ` ` `0` `.`   `  ` `+1` `-1`
  - For example, `Numpad /` + `Numpad 7` will set the time to `9`.
  - Press `Numpad 0` in-between to add 1 hour. For example, `Numpad /` + `Numpad 0` + `Numpad 7` will set the time to `10`.
  - Press `Numpad .` in-between to subtract 1 hour. For example, `Numpad /` + `Numpad 0` + `Numpad 7` will set the time to `8`.
  - Press `Numpad *` in-between to add 24 hours. For example, `Numpad /` + `Numpad *` + `Numpad 7` will set the time to `9` tomorrow.
  - And yes, you guessed it, `Numpad /` + `Numpad *` + `Numpad 0` + `Numpad 7` will set the time to `10` tomorrow.
    - `/` to trigger, `*` for tomorrow, `0` to add 1 hour, `7` for 9 hours. Tomorrow at 9 + 1 = 10. Simple :)
	- Some keyboards might limit such combinations, but you won't need them most times anyway.
  - `Numpad /` + `Numpad 5` is imposter, so it just opens the clock screen for you.

### 🎣 Automation (toggleable)
- Auto loot pickup.
  - Works with some prompts too. Should ignore dialogues, cooking, and challenges.
- Auto unfreeze/unbubble.
- Auto fishing.
  - You only have to throw the rod. Pulling and catching are done automatically.
  - Now you should just click `LMB` to toggle rod casting mode instead of holding.
- Easier/Lazy combat.
  - Hold `LMB` to spam normal attack.
  - Press `RMB` to perform charged attack.
    - Some characters have different charge attacks depending on the holding duration. You can hold `RMB` a bit more if needed.

### ⚙ Additional info
All links are stored inside the `yags_data/links.ini` file. You may remove/add your own stuff to your liking.

Just in case:
- `LMB`: Left Mouse Button
- `RMB`: Right Mouse Button
- `MMB`: Middle Mouse Button
- `XButton1`: Side Mouse Button 1
- `XButton2`: Side Mouse Button 2

`XButton1` and `XButton2` actions can be swapped (since different mouses use different mappings for some reason).
